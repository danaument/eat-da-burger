### <a name="Description">Description:</a>
This project is a full-stack app that demonstrates CRUD functionality using Express.js, Mysql.js, and a custom ORM in a simple MVC framework.  This project serves as a homework assignment submission for UT's web dev coding bootcamp.  It contains a codebase and a deployed webpage.

### <a name="Notes">Notes from Dan:  </a>
This project was my first truly full-stack application.  I enjoyed the process, but the prompt ("eat da burger") was very silly.  I was ultimately successful using the promisify utility to avoid passing callback functions all the way through my models and ORM.  In the future I plan on using mysql2.js for its promises and easier handling of objects in creating queries.  Also, I had grand plans to include a Font Awesome burger icon, but Bootstrap 4.6 has some compatability issues with Font Awesome 5.  The project can be found on my updated portfolio at https://danaument.github.io/updated-portfolio/.
